# SFDDM

This is the code for the algorithm proposed by our paper:

"Chi Hong, Jiyue Huang, Robert Birke, Dick Epema, Stefanie Roos, and Lydia Y. Chen.
"Single-fold Distillation for Diffusion models." In European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD), 2025."

This project relies on https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch/tree/main to implement diffusion models. To facilitating users, we provide a copy in this repo.

Then you will get the pretrained diffusion model on imagenet, and you can run the experiments. You may replace the pretrained models by yours.

An example of running the algorithm is shown in "main.py".
